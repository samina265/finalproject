* **Strong AI (General AI):** Capable of performing a wide range of tasks
Bot:  that require human-level intelligence, such as understanding complex concepts, reasoning, and making ethical decisions.
* **Super AI:** Hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects.

**Methods of AI:**

* **Machine Learning (ML):** Algorithms that enable computers to learn from data without explicit programming.
* **Deep Learning (DL):** A subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to process data.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Enables computers to understand and generate human language.
* **Computer Vision:** Gives computers the ability to "see" and analyze images and videos.
Bot: 
* **Robotics:** Combines AI with physical embodiment, allowing robots to navigate, interact with their environment, and perform tasks autonomously.

**Applications of AI:**

AI has numerous applications across various industries, including:

* Healthcare: Diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug discovery
* Finance: Fraud detection, risk assessment, and investment analysis
* Manufacturing: Automation, quality control, and supply chain optimization
* Transportation: Self-driving cars, traffic management, and logistics
